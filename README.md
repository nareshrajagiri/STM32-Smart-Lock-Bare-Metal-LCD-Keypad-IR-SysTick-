## üìå Project Overview
This project is a **Protected Door Lock System** implemented on an **STM32F407G-DISC1** board, programmed in **pure bare-metal C** (no HAL, no RTOS in this version).  
It uses:
- **16x2 LCD** in 4-bit mode (for user messages)
- **4x3 Keypad** (for password entry)
- **IR Sensor** (for detecting user presence)

The system enforces **increasing delays** for wrong password attempts and locks completely after 4 failed tries.

## üéØ Features
- **Active LOW IR sensor detection** to start password entry
- **4-digit password authentication**
- **Delay penalties**:
  - 1st wrong: 10 sec
  - 2nd wrong: 20 sec
  - 3rd wrong: 30 sec
  - 4th wrong: Permanent lock
- **Masked password entry** on LCD
- **Pure register-level programming** (no HAL, no libraries)

## üß† Methodology
1. **Hardware Initialization**
   - Configure GPIO for LCD, keypad, and IR sensor.
   - Initialize SysTick for delays.
2. **LCD & Keypad Setup**
   - LCD in 4-bit mode.
   - Keypad scanning via row/column method.
3. **IR Sensor Integration**
   - Monitor IR sensor state.
   - Trigger password entry on detection.
4. **Password Authentication**
   - Accept 4-digit password.
   - Compare with predefined password.
5. **Security Feedback**
   - Access granted or denied messages.
   - Delay penalties for wrong attempts.
6. **System Lock**
   - After 4 wrong attempts, lock permanently.
